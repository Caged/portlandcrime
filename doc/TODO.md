It's still early in development and lacking some core features, but I think 
it's a good start.  The data is updated daily and is provided by the city.

# A few things I have on my TODO list:
  * Find some way to fix and/or cluster overlapping crimes
  * Cross reference with poverty and educational data.
  * Crime stats along the Max lines
  * Heat maps
  * Quadrant statistics
  * Remove Gresham, Beaverton, and other non-Portland proper crimes.

  
# Future Ideas
  * Seasonal statistics
  * Weather statistics
  * Historical Census Data
  * Replay the day: Time-lapse map & graph of incidents played over a specific time period.
  * Take back this block: Identifies troubled areas in Portland and encourages 
    citizens to come together and help solve problems.
