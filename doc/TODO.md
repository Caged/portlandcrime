It's still early in development and lacking some core features, but I think 
it's a good start.  The data is updated daily and is provided by the city.

# A few things I have on my TODO list:
  * Callout details when clicking on crimes
  * Find some way to fix and/or cluster overlapping crimes
  * Historical Comparison (2009 vs 2010)
  * Neighborhood Details & Stats

  
# Future Ideas
  * Take back this block: Identifies troubled areas in Portland and encourages 
    citizens to come together and help solve problems.
  * Cross reference with poverty and educational data.
